# DI_vs_DIP
Dependy Injection versus Dependency Inversion Principle

**Dependency Inversion** (DIP) and **Dependency Injection** (DI) are related but distinct concepts within object-oriented programming and software design, which often they get confused. Let's look at each of them and what SOLID principles they correspond to:

### Dependency Inversion (DIP)
- **Principle:** DIP is one of the five SOLID principles, specifically the "D" in SOLID.
- **Concept:** DIP refers to a method of decoupling software modules. This principle states that:
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes).
   - Abstractions should not depend on details. The details (concrete implementations) must depend on the abstractions.
- **Purpose:** The goal is to reduce direct dependency between software components, so that changes to a low-level module do not affect high-level modules, making the system more maintainable and scalable.

### Dependency Injection (DI)
- **Mechanism:** DI is a design pattern that implements DIP.
- **Concept:** DI is a technique to achieve inversion of control (a broader concept) between classes and their dependencies. A class should not instantiate its dependencies directly. Instead, dependencies are "injected" into the class, usually through the constructor, a setter method, or directly into the field.
- **Purpose:** DI allows a class to be more independent of how its dependencies are created. This improves the modularity of the software and makes it easier to test classes in isolation (with mocks or stubs).

### Why are they confused?
- **Related Terminology:** DI is a way of doing DIP, so they are related and it is easy to confuse the pattern with the principle.
- **Both Deal with Dependencies:** Both concepts deal with managing dependencies in software design, which can lead to confusion.
- **Principle vs. Implementation:** DIP is a high-level design principle, while DI is a practical implementation technique. In technical discussions, it is common to focus on how something is coded (DI), which can overshadow why it is done that way (DIP).

During a technical interview, to avoid confusion, you can focus on the following points:

- **DIP** is about the structure and design of the code to reduce coupling.
- **DI** is a concrete technique for injecting dependencies into a class, allowing that class to not have to worry about how to create its dependencies.

Understanding and being able to explain both concepts with clear examples will demonstrate a deep understanding of software design principles and patterns.
